# üêÑ&nbsp;FeedLot, The FeedBot&nbsp;ü§ñ

FLTFB is a RSS and Atom fetcher.  It fetches feeds and stores them in a SQLite database.  It's designed to run in
a container and for easy integration with other tools and processes.  It doesn't do much of anything else.  

It's designed for use with [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/), but could very well be used for other
things, such as a personal feed reader or podcast aggregator.

## Container Mount Points

Mount Point | Description | Notes
----------- | ----------- | ----
/db         | SQLite database | 
/data       | Data directory |
/data/definitions.txt | List of feeds to fetch | a list of feeds to fetch on the format `domain_name feed_url`

If the definitions are intended to be mutable over the course of the runtime of the container,
the `definitions.txt` file needs to be updated by an external process, such as a git pull.

The container will automatically reload the `definitions.txt` on each update.

## Environment Variables

Properties are set via FEEDLOT_OPTS. Set these properties like -Dproperty=value in the FEEDLOT_OPTS environment variable in the container.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- |---------| ----------- |
feedlot.max-avg-posts-per-year | 24      | Maximum average number of posts per year.  Feeds with more posts than this will be ignored.  Useful to avoid feeds with a lot of noise.
feedlot.max-feed-items | 10      | Maximum number of items to persist from a feed.
bind.ip | 0.0.0.0 | IP address to bind the API to.
bind.port | 8080    | Port to bind the API to.

## API endpoints

By default the API listens on port 8080.
